## Welcome to the Martian Tower Codebase!

### What can I get access to?
At the moment I work as a Site Reliability Engineer (Software Engineer) so my current repos are SRE related tools/research. I also plan to store some of my hobby projects (Which are few, as I don't do that much coding in my freetime) and some of my old stuff from high school/college.

### Access to Work repositories
If you are one of my coworkers and need a copy of my work projects, please make a professional github account with your work email (if you don't already have one) and email me your professional github username.
My work emails:
* martin619@revature.net
* martin.delatorre@hitachivantara.com

### Access to my Personal repositories
If you'd like to know what personal repositories I have and/or gain access to them, you're going to have to ask me in person. It's a lot of messy code and school projects. Also don't forget to tell me your github username so I can add you.
